# Report-Creator-C

This program receives people's data from a file and outputs it. The user inputs the file name then selects to either create a report, sorted by last name, or shipping labels, sorted by zip code. The program prints copies of the sorted info to the screen and to an output file.

"data5.txt" has been included to test with the program.
